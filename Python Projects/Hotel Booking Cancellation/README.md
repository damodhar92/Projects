# Hotel Booking Cancellation Python Project

### Problem Statement 
In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including decreasing revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.
